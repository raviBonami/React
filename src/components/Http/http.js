// Used to fetch/post data from the server
// React is a library, so it doesn't have its owm
// http methods
// Also, since react re-renders only when there is 
// change in props and state values, it means we have
// send data we receive from any api call into props
// or state

// So, in react we use external libraries to perform this
// axios, fetch for example

// axios - npm install axios

// import axios library where you want you want to make 
// http request
